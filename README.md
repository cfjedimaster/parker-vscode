# Parker Extension

This is a simple [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) extension for the [Parker CSS Analysis](https://github.com/katiefenn/parker/) tool. Simply open up a CSS file and execute 
the command `Show Parker Analysis`. Parker will be run against the current file and the report will
be displayed on the right side of the editor. As you type, it will automatically update.

Full credit for this extension goes again to Microsoft. I copied/modified the code from their sample here:
